			<h2>Easy Apple Crisp</h2>
			by Jenn Clark
			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<h4>For the Apples</h4>
					<li>6 large apples, 2½ pounds, peeled, cored, and chopped into ¾-inch pieces</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
					<li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
					<li>½ teaspoon nutmeg</li>

				<h4>Crumble Topping</h4>
					<li>¾ cup whole rolled oats</li>
					<li>½ cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
					<li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
					<li>½ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
					<li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>
					<li>½ cup cold unsalted butter, 1 stick, cubed, plus more for the pan</li>

			</ul>
			<h3>Directions</h3>
			<p>Preheat the oven to 375°F and grease an 8x8-inch baking dish. Prepare the apples: In a large bowl, place the chopped apples, flour, brown sugar, lemon juice,
				vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Toss to coat the apples, then spread evenly in the
				prepared baking dish. Make the topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and
				salt. Use two forks, a pastry cutter, or your hands to work in the butter until the mixture is
				crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over the apples. Cover the baking dish and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the apples are bubbling. Uncover
				and bake for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until the apples are tender and the topping is golden
				brown and lightly crisp.Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. </p>
